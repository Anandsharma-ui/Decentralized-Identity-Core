# Decentralized-Identity-Core
# Decentralized Identity using Blockchain

A decentralized identity system built on blockchain that empowers users to own, manage, and control their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. This project aims to provide secure, private, and tamper-proof digital identity verification using smart contracts.

## 🌐 Overview

Traditional identity systems rely heavily on centralized organizations, which can lead to privacy concerns, data breaches, and single points of failure. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to create a self-sovereign identity system where:

- Users control their own identities.
- Identity data is stored securely and immutably.
- Verification is trustless and transparent.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 User-owned identities (Self-Sovereign Identity)
- 📄 Immutable identity records on blockchain
- 🧾 Verifiable credentials and claims
- 👥 Role-based access to identity attributes
- 🧠 Smart contract powered identity lifecycle (create, update, revoke)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / Polygon / any EVM-based chain
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: React.js (optional if you’re building a UI)
- **Backend (optional)**: Node.js / Express.js for API integration
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask or WalletConnect
- **Storage (optional)**: IPFS for off-chain identity documents
